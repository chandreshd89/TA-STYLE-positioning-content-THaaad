          <p>
            In our urban and suburban houses what should we do without cats? In
            our sitting or bedrooms, our libraries, in our kitchens and
            storerooms, our farms, barns, and rickyards, in our docks, our
            granaries, our ships, and our wharves, in our corn markets, meat
            markets, and other places too numerous to mention, how useful they
            are! In our ships, however, the rats oft set them at defiance; still
            they are of great service.</p><br>
            <p> How wonderfully patient is the cat when
            watching for rats or mice, awaiting their egress from their place of
            refuge or that which is their home! How well Shakespeare in
            Pericles, Act iii., describes this keen attention of the cat to its
            natural pursuit!</p><br>
                  <p class="article"> The cat, with eyne of burning coal, Now crouches
                   from (before) the mouse's hole.</p><br> 
            <p> A slight rustle, and the fugitive
            comes forth; a quick, sharp, resolute motion, and the cat has proved
            its usefulness. Let any one have a plague of rats and mice, as I
            once had, and let them be delivered therefrom by cats, as I was, and
            they will have a lasting and kind regard for them.
